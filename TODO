• homed adopt
• factory reset
• image policy

todo:
• https boot
• luks recovery key firstboot prompt
• installer tool (wrapping repart, bootctl install, tpm2-clear, reboot)
• hostnamectl should show image id
• hostname should start from image id, not distro name
• make sure reset and so on are never candidates for auto selection in menu
• boot counting
• in live mode: mark root block device read-only on block level
• pcrlock
• sysupdate from http
• ask for comfirmation before factory reset
• pkcs7 for image downloads, rather than gpg
